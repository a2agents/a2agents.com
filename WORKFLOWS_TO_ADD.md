# GitHub Actions Workflows - Manual Installation Required

Due to GitHub App permissions, the workflow files could not be pushed automatically.
They are available locally and need to be added manually.

## Files to Add

The following workflow files have been created in `.github/workflows/`:

1. **test-new-new-news.yml** - Automated testing workflow
2. **demo-new-new-news.yml** - Interactive demo workflow
3. **README.md** - Documentation for the workflows

## How to Add Them

### Option 1: Via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to: https://github.com/a2agents/a2agents.com
2. Navigate to `.github/workflows/` (create if doesn't exist)
3. Click "Add file" â†’ "Create new file"
4. Copy content from local files shown below
5. Commit directly to the branch

### Option 2: From Your Local Machine

```bash
# Clone the repo on your local machine
git clone https://github.com/a2agents/a2agents.com.git
cd a2agents.com

# Checkout the branch
git checkout claude/youcom-api-exploration-011CUaZkXPcSTYpT9Aam3XQ9

# Copy workflow files from docs to workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp docs/github-actions/*.yml .github/workflows/

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflows"
git push
```

## File Locations

The workflow files are available in the repository at:
- `docs/github-actions/test-new-new-news.yml`
- `docs/github-actions/demo-new-new-news.yml`
- `docs/github-actions/README.md`

These need to be copied to `.github/workflows/` in your repository to be active.

## File Contents

The complete workflow files with all configuration are available in:
- `docs/github-actions/test-new-new-news.yml` - Automated testing
- `docs/github-actions/demo-new-new-news.yml` - Interactive demos
- `docs/github-actions/README.md` - Complete documentation

## Why This Happened

GitHub Apps require the `workflows` permission to create or modify files in `.github/workflows/`.
This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized workflow modifications.

## Next Steps

1. Add the workflow files manually (using one of the options above)
2. Workflows will then be available in the Actions tab
3. You can trigger them manually or they'll run automatically on push/PR

**Note:** All other code has been successfully pushed to the repository.
Only the GitHub Actions workflows require manual addition.
