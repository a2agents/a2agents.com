# You.com API Status Report
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Project:** New New News - 2020 Human Artifacts Index

---

## Executive Summary

The New New News system is **partially functional** but cannot retrieve real data due to You.com API endpoint failures. The API key is valid, but only 1 of 3 required endpoints is operational.

---

## API Endpoint Status

### ✅ `/search` - **WORKING**
- **Status:** Operational
- **Response:** 200 OK
- **Functionality:** Returns real web search results
- **Example Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "hits": [
      {
        "url": "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/index.html",
        "title": "COVID-19 Vaccination Clinical and Professional Resources | CDC",
        "description": "Learn about COVID-19 vaccination...",
        "snippets": ["Your hub for the latest COVID-19 vaccination..."]
      }
    ],
    "latency": 0.20
  }
  ```

### ❌ `/news` - **FAILING**
- **Status:** Server Error
- **Response:** 500 Internal Server Error
- **Impact:** Web Researcher agent falls back to mock data
- **Error Message:** `"Internal Server Error"`
- **Test Command:**
  ```bash
  curl -X GET 'https://api.ydc-index.io/news?query=COVID%20vaccine&count=3' \
    -H 'X-API-Key: <key>'
  ```

### ❌ `/rag` - **FAILING**
- **Status:** Authentication Error
- **Response:** 403 Forbidden
- **Impact:** Pricing Normalizer agent falls back to mock data
- **Error Message:** `{"message":"Missing Authentication Token"}`
- **Possible Cause:** RAG endpoint may require different authentication or not be included in API plan
- **Test Command:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST 'https://api.ydc-index.io/rag' \
    -H 'X-API-Key: <key>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"query": "COVID vaccine development"}'
  ```

## Current System Behavior

When running with `--no-mock` flag:

1. **Orchestrator** ✅ - Works (no API calls)
2. **Web Researcher** ⚠️ - Attempts `/news`, gets 500 error, falls back to mock data
3. **Pricing Normalizer** ⚠️ - Attempts `/rag`, gets 403 error, falls back to mock data
4. **Citation Verifier** ✅ - Works with fallback data
5. **Report Composer** ✅ - Works with fallback data

**Result:** System completes successfully but outputs mock data instead of real research results.

---

## Testing Results

### Local Execution Test
```bash
./run_new_new_news.sh "COVID vaccine" --max-artifacts 2 --no-mock
```

**Output:**
- ✅ Script runs successfully
- ❌ Returns mock data: `Total Value: $535,375` (fictional)
- ⚠️ Logs show:
  - `API Error in news_search: 500 Server Error`
  - `API Error in rag_query: 403 Client Error: Forbidden`
  - `Falling back to mock data...`

### GitHub Actions Test
- Organization secret `YOU_API_KEY` is accessible
- Same API errors occur in CI/CD environment
- Workflow completes but uses mock data

---

## Investigation Summary

### Root Cause Analysis

**Issue 1: Development Environment**
- Initially, Python commands were hanging when executed from `new_new_news/` directory
- **Cause:** Missing `requests` module in system Python
- **Solution:** Created virtual environment with dependencies
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv new_new_news/venv
  source new_new_news/venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

**Issue 2: API Endpoint Failures**
- `/news` endpoint returns server-side error (500)
- `/rag` endpoint rejects authentication (403)
- **Not a local issue:** Confirmed via direct curl tests

---

## API Key Validation

✅ **API Key is Valid**
- Format: `ydc-sk-ee8bd1fdc14d83e4-jrMlR51eNr6VYBou1o9KX7UBSy1nWosS-be4e9be7<__>1SJLaUETU8N2v5f4XPe6NHD5`
- Length: 93 characters
- Works successfully with `/search` endpoint
- Properly configured as organization secret in GitHub

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Contact You.com Support (Recommended)
**Questions to ask:**
1. Why is the `/news` endpoint returning 500 Internal Server Error?
2. Is the `/rag` endpoint available for our API plan tier?
3. Does RAG require different authentication (e.g., bearer token instead of X-API-Key header)?
4. Is there scheduled maintenance affecting these endpoints?

**Support Contact:** https://api.you.com (check for support email/chat)

### Option 2: Modify Code to Use Working Endpoint
**Approach:**
- Refactor `WebResearcherAgent` to use `/search` instead of `/news`
- Refactor `PricingNormalizerAgent` to use `/search` or alternative method
- Update API client in `you_api_client.py`

**Pros:**
- Can proceed without waiting for support
- `/search` endpoint is proven to work

**Cons:**
- `/news` may provide better time-filtered results for 2020 artifacts
- `/rag` likely provides better context for pricing valuations

### Option 3: Continue with Mock Data (Not Recommended)
- System works for testing/development
- Cannot produce real research results
- Defeats the purpose of the multi-agent system

## Files Created During Investigation

1. `new_new_news/venv/` - Virtual environment with dependencies
2. `new_new_news/test_api.py` - Minimal API test script
3. `run_new_new_news.sh` - Wrapper script for easy execution
4. `test_you_api.sh` - Endpoint testing script
5. This report: `API_STATUS_REPORT.md`

---

## Quick Reference Commands

### Test API endpoints:
```bash
./test_you_api.sh
```

### Run New New News with real API attempt:
```bash
./run_new_new_news.sh "your query" --max-artifacts 5 --no-mock
```

### Run with mock data (no API needed):
```bash
./run_new_new_news.sh "your query" --max-artifacts 5
```

---

## Conclusion

The system is **code-complete and functional**, but **blocked by You.com API issues**. The API key works, the code works, but 2 of 3 required endpoints are non-functional.

**Immediate Action Required:** Contact You.com support to resolve `/news` (500) and `/rag` (403) endpoint issues.
